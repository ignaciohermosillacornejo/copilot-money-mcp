/**
 * Class-level detector for issue #662.
 *
 * Every collection the decoder returns passes through a dedup step, because
 * LevelDB can hold the same Firestore document more than once. The question
 * each dedup answers is "are these two rows the same document?" — and the only
 * safe answer is the document's identity, never its contents.
 *
 * #662 was an account dedup keyed on `${name ?? official_name}|${mask ?? ''}`.
 * Two accounts at one institution can share a provider name and carry no mask,
 * so one of them was discarded before any caller could see it — no error, no
 * warning, no count mismatch. A real cache decoded two fewer accounts than the
 * live GraphQL surface returned. Accounts were the only content-keyed dedup in
 * the decoder; every sibling already keyed on its id.
 *
 * This test makes each dedup prove it. For every collection it seeds TWO
 * documents that are byte-for-byte identical in content and differ only by id,
 * then asserts both survive — on the standalone decoder AND on the single-pass
 * aggregate, since #662 shipped two independent copies of the same bad key.
 *
 * Any future dedup that reaches for a content heuristic instead of an identity
 * fails here, whatever the field it picks.
 *
 * Two deliberate omissions, so they don't read as oversights:
 *
 * - `goal_history` (keyed on goal_id + month) and `investment_prices` (keyed on
 *   security + price_type + period) are excluded because their keys ARE their
 *   identities — those collections store one document per tuple, and the tuple
 *   is what the Firestore path encodes. "Two documents identical in content but
 *   differing by id" is not expressible for them.
 * - This proves distinct documents survive, not that true storage duplicates are
 *   collapsed. `createTestDb` writes one row per id, so a genuinely double-stored
 *   document cannot be built in a fixture — the same limitation #122 had.
