# Testing Guide for Claude Desktop

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the Copilot Money MCP Server in Claude Desktop.

## Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:

1. **Claude Desktop** installed (latest version)
   - Download from: https://claude.ai/desktop

2. **Copilot Money** installed with local database
   - The server reads from the local LevelDB cache at: `~/Library/Containers/com.copilot.production/Data/Library/Application Support/firestore/__FIRAPP_DEFAULT/copilot-production-22904/main`
   - Make sure you have transaction data in Copilot Money

3. **Bun or Node.js 18+**
   ```bash
   bun --version  # Recommended
   # or
   node --version
   ```

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Install from .mcpb File (Recommended)

This is the simplest method for testing:

1. **Locate the .mcpb file**:
   ```bash
   ls -lh copilot-money-mcp.mcpb
   ```
   Should show: ~318KB file

2. **Double-click the .mcpb file**:
   - Claude Desktop should open automatically
   - You'll see an installation prompt
   - Click "Install"
   - Restart Claude Desktop

3. **Verify installation**:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Go to: Settings → Developer → MCP Servers
   - You should see: `copilot-money-mcp` (enabled ✓)

### Method 2: Manual Installation

If double-clicking doesn't work:

1. **Copy .mcpb to Claude's directory**:
   ```bash
   cp copilot-money-mcp.mcpb ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/mcpb/
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Desktop**:
   - Quit Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q)
   - Reopen Claude Desktop
   - The server should now appear in Settings

### Method 3: Development Mode (For Testing Changes)

For active development and testing:

1. **Edit Claude Desktop config**:
   ```bash
   code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. **Add the server manually**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "copilot-money-dev": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "/Users/nach/Projects/copilot-money-mcp/dist/cli.js"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

## Verifying Installation

### Check Server Status

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to: **Settings → Developer → MCP Servers**
3. Look for: `copilot-money-mcp`
4. Status should show: **Connected** (green indicator)

### Check Available Tools

Start a new conversation in Claude Desktop and ask:

```
What MCP tools do you have access to?
```

You should see 8 tools listed:
- `get_transactions` - Query transactions with filtering
- `get_accounts` - List all accounts with balances
- `get_categories` - Get spending by category
- `get_recurring_transactions` - Find recurring/subscription charges
- `get_budgets` - View budget tracking
- `get_goals` - View financial goals
- `get_cache_info` - Check database cache status
- `refresh_database` - Refresh the database cache

### First-Time Tool Approvals ⚠️

**Important:** When you first use each tool, Claude Desktop will show an approval prompt. This is normal security behavior.

**What you'll see:**
1. First query triggers an approval dialog
2. Dialog shows:
   - Tool name (e.g., "get_transactions")
   - Tool description
   - Parameters being passed (e.g., `{"period": "this_month", "limit": 30}`)
3. Options: "Allow" or "Deny"

**Expected behavior:**
- **8 separate approvals** - One for each tool when first used
- **One-time only** - After approving, no more prompts for that tool
- **Persistent** - Approvals survive Claude Desktop restarts

**Why this happens:**
- Claude Desktop requires explicit consent before any MCP tool accesses data
- Even read-only tools (with `readOnlyHint: true`) require approval
- This is by design for security, not a bug or configuration issue

**What to do:**
1. Click "Allow" when prompted
2. Continue with your query
3. If you use a different tool, approve it when prompted
4. After approving all 8 tools once, testing becomes seamless

**Tip:** Try using multiple tools in your first test session to get approvals out of the way!

## Performance Testing

### Response Time

For each tool, measure response time:

```
[Ask question]
[Note start time]
[Wait for response]
[Note end time]
```

**Targets:**
- Simple queries: <2 seconds
- Complex queries (with filtering): <5 seconds
- Search queries: <3 seconds

If any query takes longer than 10 seconds, report as a performance issue.

### Memory Usage

Monitor memory usage during testing:

1. **Open Activity Monitor** (Cmd+Space → "Activity Monitor")
2. **Find the MCP server process**: Search for "node" or "copilot-money-mcp"
3. **Monitor memory**: Should stay under 100MB

**Expected Memory:**
- Initial load: ~20-50MB
- After queries: ~30-70MB
- Peak usage: <100MB

If memory exceeds 200MB, report as a memory leak.

## Error Handling Tests

Test how the server handles errors:

### Test 1: Database Not Found

1. **Temporarily rename the database directory**:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Library/Containers/com.copilot.production/Data/Library/Application\ Support/firestore \
      ~/Library/Containers/com.copilot.production/Data/Library/Application\ Support/firestore.backup
   ```

2. **Try a query**: "Show me my transactions"

3. **Expected Result**:
   - Clear error message: "Database not found" or similar
   - No crash or hang
   - Helpful suggestion to check Copilot Money installation

4. **Restore the database**:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Library/Containers/com.copilot.production/Data/Library/Application\ Support/firestore.backup \
      ~/Library/Containers/com.copilot.production/Data/Library/Application\ Support/firestore
   ```

### Test 2: Invalid Date Period

Try queries with invalid dates:

```
Show me transactions from "invalid_date"
Get spending for "not_a_period"
```

**Expected Result**:
- Clear error message
- Suggestion for valid formats
- No crash

### Test 3: Empty Results

Try queries that should return no results:

```
Find transactions for merchant "NONEXISTENT_MERCHANT_12345"
Show me spending on category "INVALID_CATEGORY"
```

**Expected Result**:
- Message: "No transactions found" or similar
- No error or crash
- Suggestion to try different filters

---

## Privacy & Security Tests

### Test 1: No Network Requests

1. **Disconnect from the internet**:
   - Turn off Wi-Fi
   - Or use Network Link Conditioner to block all traffic

2. **Try several queries**:
   - All queries should still work
   - No "network error" messages

3. **Expected Result**:
   - All tools work offline
   - No network requests attempted

### Test 2: Read-Only Access

Verify the server doesn't modify data:

1. **Note current transaction count** in Copilot Money
2. **Run multiple queries** through Claude Desktop
3. **Check Copilot Money** - transaction count should be unchanged
4. **Check database files**:
   ```bash
   ls -l ~/Library/Containers/com.copilot.production/Data/Library/Application\ Support/firestore/__FIRAPP_DEFAULT/copilot-production-22904/main/*.ldb
   ```
   Modification times should not change from MCP queries

**Expected Result**:
- Database files not modified by MCP
- No new transactions created
- All data remains unchanged

---

## Integration Tests

### Test 1: Multiple Queries in Sequence

Test a conversation with multiple queries:

```
User: What's my total balance?
Claude: [Shows balance]
User: Show me my last 5 transactions
Claude: [Shows transactions]
User: How much did I spend on dining last month?
Claude: [Shows spending breakdown]
```

**Expected Result**:
- All queries work correctly
- Context is maintained
- No performance degradation

### Test 2: Complex Natural Language

Test with complex, natural queries:

```
"I'm trying to understand my spending habits. Can you show me how much I spent on groceries and dining out combined last month, and compare that to my total spending?"
```

**Expected Result**:
- Claude correctly interprets the query
- Multiple tool calls are made if needed
- Results are synthesized and presented clearly
